Now that I've completed [three intensive months](http://bloc.io) of full-stack Ruby on Rails training, I decided that the next project on my docket was to set up my own blog – one that I can use for the long hall.

But it wasn't clearly the next item on my list of project ideas until I stumbled upon this [little beauty called](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme) "HPSTR", a theme for Jekyll.  Before I found that, I was planning on using the shiny new blog engine ["Ghost"](http://ghost.org), which I _do_ still want to try out on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com).

So here's how the setup process went for me as I tried to build this new blog.
