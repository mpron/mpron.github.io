This is the first installment of my **"Linksheets"** series.  It's a simple, yet surprisingly rare resource that will be beneficial in outlining the breadth of a complex topic and supplying newcomers with the definitive information sources for it.  My inspiration for Linksheets comes from a post that no longer exists on the web called ["My Node.js Linksheet."](https://web.archive.org/web/20120731044333/http://filer.progstr.com/1/post/2012/04/my-nodejs-linksheet.html)

My first foray into this resource is going to be a soft topic: remote work.  Specifically, working in remote software development teams.

Obviously, they use their own tools internally and recommend them, so there's bias but the advice is solid.

### Pair Programming
Pair programming is another big topic on its own, but it's an especially useful tactic in remote teams. Here is just one fun article that groups various pair programming styles into different *personas*.
