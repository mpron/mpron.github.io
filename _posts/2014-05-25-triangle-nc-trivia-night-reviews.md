Two weeks ago, on a wim, I decided to see if I could find a good trivia night near my place in Cary or somewhere in the Triangle.  I've been meaning to find a new trivia night that I could get some of my old trivia buddies to come to. We used to go to trivia on Tuesday nights at Linda's Bar in Chapel Hill. When they lost their good host, they stopped going.  

With the number of bars around Durham, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, Cary, and Morrisville, you can easily a new place to play trivia every night of the week. So for Monday through Thursday of that week, that's basically what I did, and then I even tried a fifth trivia night the next week.  What follows are my reviews of those trivia nights.

# Doherty's Irish Pub
1979 High House Rd

Cary, NC 27519

Phone number (919) 388-9930

Starts at 8pm on **Mondays**

**Host:**

 - Professional/Experienced at doing trivia
Give hints if you need it when he comes around for answers

**Questions:**

 - Mainly pop culture (categories from the night I went: Ad slogans, comedians, name-that-muppet video slides)
Music questions happen mainly if the video isn't working, according to the host.

 - Mostly easy questions (if you know the category).  I'd say the questions could stand to be a little harder (they only got hard-ish in the last few questions of the round). If you intend to win, you'll have to get almost all the questions and bonuses right.

**Venue:**

 - It was a nice clean tavern with a u-shaped bar for lots of seating around it, and several more tall-chair tables. The patio was a nice place to hang out between rounds as well. A smaller trivia venue than most I've been to, but the crowd was smallish so it worked out.

 - Air conditioning was almost too cold, but it's almost summer so it's understandable.  I went outside where it was a bit warmer between rounds.
 
**Crowd:** 

 - 30s, 40s, and a few 50s. There were just barely enough in the 30s range for me to feel like there was a group of peers (27). I was able to pick up team members that came in after 8pm that were in their 30s, so it was a good night in terms of socializing.

 - Maybe 20-25 people in the trivia area near the bar.

# Steel String Brewery
106 S Greensboro St
Carrboro, NC 27510
Phone number (919) 240-7215
Starts at 9:15pm on **Tuesdays**

**Host:** 

 - Can't make a fair judgement on this one because he was a fill-in for
   the regular host.

 - Trivia is supposed to start at 9pm but I changed the time to 9:15
   because there was a lot of delays when getting started.

**Questions:**

 - First off, there's a rule that only teams of four or less can compete
   for the prizes, so if you commonly bring groups bigger than that to
   these things, you're gonna have to just play for fun.

 - The questions are pretty tough but not impossible. The first round
   had more academic questions than pop culture but you get both.

 - There's always some connecting theme between the questions too.  The
   second round was really tough because they were mostly obscure movies
   from the 90s and early 00s that were based loosely on Shakespeare
   plays.

 - There was a music round at the end, but I didn't stay to review that
   because I was already kinda bored by the end of round 2 and the time
   between rounds was taking forever.
 - I left around 10:30 and they had just finished round 2 of 5, so this
   trivia is really for the night owls.

**Venue:**

 - Small space, and I like the decor. They have some nice outside
   seating but no trivia out there, as expected. 
 - The acoustics make it pretty noisy inside.

**Crowd:**

 - Mainly 20 somethings with a few in their 30s I'm sure.  The crowd was
   nosier because it wasn't a restaurant as well as a bar.

 - Most people had large groups or their groups of 2 and 4 so there was
   no team to join or other people who came alone to team up with.

# West End Tavern
2734 N Carolina 55
Cary, NC 27519
Phone:(919) 303-9300
Starts at 7pm **Wednesdays**

**Host:**

 - Cool host who walked around through the main area. He was an older
   guy so the whole trivia experience had an older sensibility.

**Questions:**

 - A good level of difficulty. And just when you thought you were going
   to come back in the music round, you have the hardest time with that.
   I was just glad they had a music round though.

**Venue:**

 - Nice and new pub.  They had a nice lounge with comfy couches but we
   didn't go there because it was to far from the trivia.
 - Our bartender, Ariel, was really cool and nice.  She introduced herself and asked our names before trivia started.

**Crowd:**

 - 40s, families, maybe some 30s.  Probably the least likely of the 4
   places I went to to meet people my age.

# Hibernian
1144 Kildaire Farm Rd
Cary, NC 27511
Phone number (919) 467-9000
Starts at 8pm on **Thursdays**

**Host:**

 - Although he didn't know how to pronounce "archipelago" he knew how to
   run trivia.
 - It took me a minute to figure out his scoring rules though because he
   said them very quickly every time and I'd had the fatal first two
   sips of my miller lite.

**Questions:**

 - Pretty easy for me and they were general enough for groups to know
   almost all of them. They did questions one by one, with a song's
   worth of time to answer. (I think I remember this being the style of
   questions for Tobacco Road Sports Bar in Durham)
 - You also bid 1, 3, or 5 points on an answer and you can only use each
   number once, because one round is three questions.

**Venue:**

 - The design of the Hibernian was the best part. The lighting and the
   layout are really classy and cozy. I immediately liked this trivia
   just for the decor.
 - The only problem was that you couldn't hear the questions unless you
   sat in a certain section of the restaurant. I missed potentially
   talking to another group around my age group because of this.

**Crowd:**

 - 30s to 40s. Pretty good diverse crowd for a rainy Thursday night. I
   think there were even some people my age there, so it might be worth
   a return trip to see if I can jump on a team next time.
 - Didn't find anyone to team up with but that was mainly because you
   could only hear in one side of the restaurant.

# Natty Greene's Pub
505 W Jones St.
Raleigh, NC 27603
Phone number (919) 232-2477
Starts at 7:30pm **Tuesdays**

**Host:** 

 - Great host from [Geeks Who Drink](http://www.geekswhodrink.com/526/), a nationwide trivia group.

 - The host did a good job of running things and had some jokes to boot.

**Questions:**

 - These questions were the perfect level of difficulty.  You didn't have to know answers outright, because sometime there'd be other clues hidden inside the question that could help.
 - Our team was medium-sized compared to many others, but we still ended up in third place, and just three points shy of first place.

**Venue:**

 - Huge space with lots of room.  They have several backup areas to hold trivia if they can't do it in the usual place, which is what happened in our case.  It was still a great spot.
 - The only issue was the noise.  But if we focused and listen we could make out the questions pretty well.  It was easy to miss one if you didn't pay attention.

**Crowd:**

 - Mainly 20 somethings and some 30 somethings.  It's not too close to the NC state campus, so I can't imagine there were a ton of college students, but there definitely were more here than any other venue.
 
# A few more places I remember
I've also been to places in Durham like Fullsteam and Tobacco Road Sports bar. Even though their questions were good, I wouldn't go back to Fullsteam because it gets waaay to hot and crowded. I would go back to Tobacco Road because they had a lot more room, but hearing has always been a bit of an issue there.  

So that's my trivia night review.  As I expected, if I want to see more people around my age, I've probably got to travel outside Cary, even though the bars are pretty nice.
