It's been a while since I last posted, so I thought I'd share some of the things that I've been working on over the past few months to delight the audience of developers I write and research for.  

This is a little resource I concocted while researching NoSQL and relational databases for the [DZone 2014 Guide to Big Data](http://www.dzone.com/research/guide-to-big-data).  It's a creation that I'm especially proud of because it takes a lot of research that a developer would have otherwise had to compile themselves, and condenses it into a simple, scannable resource that provides actionable information for picking databases to test in their projects.

Have a look at *Finding the Database for Your Use Case*.
