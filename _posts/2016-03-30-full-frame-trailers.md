I like documentaries. And if Jinx, Serial, and Making a Murderer are any indication, so do a lot of people. I've gone to just a handful of documentaries in the past two years at Durham, NC's [Full Frame Documentary Film Festival](http://www.fullframefest.org/). It's a good opportunity for locals to see some great (often timely) films while they make the festival circuit. For me, they usually provide a rare opportunity to learn something I didn't know before or be inspired.

While the web page gives a nice description of the many films (and there are a lot) there are often trailers online for these documentaries that I'd want to hunt down so I could get a real sense for the tone of the films and a feel for their stories. This year, I decided to just make a blog post and share all the trailers I could find for the films with everyone—in hopes that you go see as many as you can if you're in town (Just to be clear, I don't work for the Full Frame fest, I'm just a fan).

So here's a copy-paste of the full frame documentary list with two additions to each film:

 - A link to a trailer or featurette (if available, some weren't) 
 - My own Ctrl+F searchable categories

The category tags were made up off the top of my head and are by no means definitive. They're just based on my own interpretation of the film's trailer and/or description. I made them because I thought they'd be helpful if you only like certain genres of documentary.  Since there are a lot, I thought I'd give you some filters to find what's relevant to you, faster.  I also marked the ones I'm personally interested in with an asterisk in the front of the title, if you want to scan that way.

Anyway, try Ctrl+F searching for some of these categories and enjoy the trailers below.  Hope you go see some!
