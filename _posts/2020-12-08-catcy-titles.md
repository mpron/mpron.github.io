If you’re not very deep into the cultural landscape of software developers (or sys admins, DevOps engineers, SREs, or anyone else who works with code for that matter…) you probably haven’t realized that the community has developed their own coded style for article and conference talk titles.

To be honest, this feels like an odd topic for a blog post. You don’t see a lot of interest in the quirky writing and title-picking tendencies of the coder world, but after following this industry for 11 years, I feel like a few newer entrants to the tech field could benefit from knowing how to entice interest from the rest of the community.

That brings us to the question: who am I writing this for? 

Maybe it’s people who are just starting out in the coding world and want to spark a little more interest in their blogs or talk submissions. 

Maybe you work in developer relations, advocacy, or content marketing and want to create things that appeal to this demographic. 

Or maybe you’re a veteran coder who will find this list entertaining—nodding along and enjoying the cleverness of our in-group (or perhaps you can tell me why people say “learn you a Haskell for great good” — I still don’t get it). 

Maybe this will help you clickbait your way to the front page of HackerNews or have the most attended talk of that conference you’re submitting an abstract for. 

Whatever your reasons for checking this out, I now present my definitive list of catchy title ideas for the world of programming. I’ll be using variables X and Y to denote a blank space in a title where any topic or adjective can go.
