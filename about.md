I am currently somewhat of a journalist for the software development beat. I often eat peanut butter and bananas, I like to make my own ringtones, I enjoy card and board games, and I play the accordion.

Recently, I've completed a couple of development courses and subsequent projects to build foundational web development skills.  There's no shortage of things I'd like to create or new technologies I'd like to try out, so this blog is just the beginning of an upcoming string of projects.
